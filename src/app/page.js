        {`Hey, I'm Calum Bradley, a 32-year-old guy with a knack for coding, a love of watching football, and a passion for staying active outdoors. When I'm not immersed in programming or catching up on the latest matches, you'll find me hitting the trails for a hike, pounding the pavement for a run, or sweating it out at the gym.`}

        {`And of course, there's Chester, my loyal Cocker Spaniel who's always by my side, ready for our next adventure. Whether we're exploring new trails or just enjoying a lazy day in the park, he's my constant companion and source of endless joy.`}

      <p className="mb-4">{`So, while I may not lace up my boots and step onto the pitch myself, there's nothing I enjoy more than cheering on my favorite teams from the comfort of my living room. From tactical masterclasses to heart-stopping moments of brilliance, football never fails to captivate me.`}</p>

        {`Join me as I navigate the thrilling world of coding, the excitement of football fandom, and the serenity of outdoor exploration, all with Chester leading the way.`}
